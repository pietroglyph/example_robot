# SpartronicsLib Example Robot
This is a project that uses most of the features of SpartronicsLib. It is supposed to serve as an example usage (the unit tests are also good examples).

To use the version of SpartronicsLib on your computer instead of the one on GitHub, pass `--include-build ../path/to/SpartronicsLib` to Gradle.
